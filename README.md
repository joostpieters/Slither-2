This repository contains the implementation of a famous Snake and Apple game which I created after following  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5F-aGDIYaM&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAjkwJocj7vlc_mFU-4wXJq) tutorial series by sentdex.

You can run this implementation with any python 2.7, python 2.7+ release along with the compatible pygame version. You can use the setup.py file to create an installer, using cx_freeze.

####Note: I was able to use cx_freeze's version to create a .msi(Microsoft Installer) file on a 64-bit windows machine only, that too for just python 3.5, other versions for windows as well as linux seem to be outdated.
